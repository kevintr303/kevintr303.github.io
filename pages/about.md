# **About Me**

Hi, I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,

I started my programming journey with a simple dream: to create video games. My love for video games and technology has driven me to explore and experiment with code ever since. There's nothing quite like the thrill of turning a vision in my head into something realâ€”**turning silly ideas into reality** is what keeps me going.

As a creative experimenter and tinkerer, I've dabbled in a variety of platforms, from Unity, Unreal, and Godot to even Roblox Studio. Every project, whether it's a polished game or a rough experiment, has taught me something new and adds to my passion for learning.

While coding is my main focus, I also have a soft spot for soccer and music. I may not always be on the field or in the studio, but following Man City and keeping up with the latest in music adds a creative spark to my life.

Enjoy exploring my work, and I hope you find something that makes you smile!
