## Welcome! ðŸŽ‰  

Hey there, I'm **Kevin Tran**, a software engineer, game developer, and explorer of ideas. If you like weird, fun, and sometimes completely unnecessary projects, you're in the right place.

### What Is This Site?  
This is my personal portfolioâ€”a hub for my projects, experiments, and random creations. I love building **interactive tools, games, and web applications**, often inspired by wacky ideas or just pure curiosity. Some projects are genuinely useful, others exist *just because they make me laugh*.  

### What Youâ€™ll Find Here  
- **Projects:** A collection of my work, from web-based tools to game development experiments.  
- **Blog Posts:** Occasional write-ups on things Iâ€™ve built, lessons learned, or just interesting tech Iâ€™m exploring.  
- **Random Ideas:** Because sometimes, you just have to make something for the fun of it.  

### Why I Build Stuff  
Ever since I started programming, Iâ€™ve been drawn to the joy of **seeing an idea come to life**. Whether itâ€™s a real-time word submission experiment (**OneWord**), a Google-style rigged RNG (**Rigged RNG Generator**), or a UnityPackage extractor that saves developers time, I love taking a concept and turning it into reality.

This site is a way for me to **share that journey**â€”and maybe even inspire someone else to build their own weird and wonderful ideas.

### Stick Around!  
Take a look around, check out my projects, and if something catches your eye, feel free to reach out. Iâ€™m always up for a good conversation about code, games, or whatever odd idea pops into my head next. ðŸ˜ƒ

Thanks for stopping by! ðŸš€
