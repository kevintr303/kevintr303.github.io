## **Introducing the Fun Page**  

Iâ€™ve added a new section to the site: **The Fun Page**.  

### **What is the Fun Page?**  
This page is dedicated to **browser-based games and interactive web experiences** Iâ€™ve built. Unlike the **Projects** page, which covers all my work, the **Fun Page** is specifically for things you can **play right in your browser**â€”no downloads, no installations, just instant access.  

### **Whatâ€™s on the Fun Page?**  
Youâ€™ll find:  
- **Web games** â€“ Playable directly in your browser.  
- **Experimental interactive projects** â€“ Not full games, but fun to mess around with.  
- **Free and accessible** â€“ Just click and play.  

### **Why This Exists**  
Some of my projects are purely for entertainmentâ€”small, quirky, and sometimes a bit ridiculous. Instead of having them hidden with the rest of the projects, I wanted to give them their own space.  

### **Check It Out**  
You can visit the Fun Page here:

Iâ€™ll be adding new games and experiments over time, so check back occasionally. If you have an idea for a fun web project, let me knowâ€”I might build it.  

Enjoy!
